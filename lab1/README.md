Repo contains naive implementations of some categorical classifiers: 1Rule, NaiveBayes, DecisionTree, KNN.

main.py runs classifiers on a small toy example. It was used to compare implementation corrects against the ones suggested in [textbook](http://csc.knu.ua/media/filer_public/16/ac/16ace84f-9784-4e9d-9b83-e210d2255e34/kryvolap_dm_final.pdf)

main-titanic runs classifiers on well-known "titanic" dataset, comparing performance and accuracy of self-implemented vs lib impls
